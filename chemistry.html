<h2>Chemistry Assignment</h2>
<p>Chemistry is a branch of science that deals with the properties, composition and behaviour of matter. it is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe</p>
<h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
<p>The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
<h2>Chemical Equations</h2>
<p>Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations. Here's an example of a chemical reaction:</p>
<b>2H <sub>2</sub> + O <sub>2</sub>&#8594 2H <sub>2</sub> O</b>
<p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H₂) and oxygen gas (O) to form water (H₂O).</p>
<h2>Important Concepts</h2>
<p>Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
<p> <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>supercript</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
